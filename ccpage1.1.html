      <h5>Overview</h5>
      Widespread cloud computing is a fairly new development in the computing industry, it offers a lot to small businesses and individuals. It would be hard to start a small business without the funds to support data storage, and sufficient room on site to keep the data. Additionally, concerning large servers, temperature control is essential, and very expensive. Cloud computing is relevant today because it allows businesses to bypass the need to allocate parts of their space to storing their data and saves them the cost of maintaining it. When servers are not in use, they can be switched off, something physical data centres are unlikely to do out the convenience of accessing data whenever they want.
      <br>
      <br>
      <h5>Efficiency</h5>
      The use of cloud computing systems can inspire companies to be more environmentally friendly, as it is an easy and beneficial first step, where other energy saving methods would incur a cost to the company. Additionally, through dynamic provisioning only the exact amount of data needed is stored, whereas companies that use their own servers will have to overestimate how much storage they need so that they do not run out. This over-estimation leads to a greatly less efficient system, and creates a net increase to carbon emissions. Data centres have access to the forefront of efficient server technology, and this means that a cloud server is likely to be far energy efficient than the current servers in use (Gangadharan and Murugesan, 2012). Using a cloud network is not only more efficient but also reduces the carbon footprint of the user, through the use of more efficient technology.
      <br>
      <br>
      <h5>Useful</h5>
      On a person to person basis, less storage intensive devices will be required, allowing the effect on the environment of this storage to be specifically targeted and kept environmentally friendly. People use information all the time, being able to store data on the cloud instead of carrying around a USB drive is not only more secure, it is far more convenient for the individual. Data can be shared to people working in the same team, no matter where they are in the world. Cloud computing can make working on projects with people anywhere much easier, as data can be transferred instantly. The data can be stored on a private cloud network to ensure that only specific people can access the data, and it is kept secure. As a result of this, cloud computing remains relevant and strikes a great appeal to the public audience.

 their private cloud. A private cloud is one in which the services and infrastructure are maintained on a private network.
