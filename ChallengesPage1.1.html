      <h1>Challenges and the Future</h1>
      <br>
      <h3>Cost</h3>
      <p>Although cloud computing is for the most part affordable, customising the platform in relation to the businesses needs can become expensive. Another cost incurred by businesses is the transferring of data to the cloud, which an especially big problem for shorter small-scale projects. When transferring larger amounts of data a sufficient amount of bandwidth is required. This can become expensive for smaller companies which in turn restricts their ability to implement cloud technology in their business process.<p>
      <h3>Staff</h3>
      <p>Not every organisation will have adequate knowledge about implementing cloud-based solutions and this can become problematic. Many businesses will have staff more suited to directly managing systems instead of indirectly through the cloud. Businesses will have to test their current staffing limits and create new roles accordingly or train old staff which can be time consuming and expensive.</p>
      <h3>Security</h3>
      <p>Security is a huge legal risk associated with cloud computing. Businesses must be aware of data protection laws that govern the storage of sensitive data as well as the type of security offered by the 3rd party host. Inadequate security services can lead to sensitive data being compromised</p>
      <h3>Energy</h3>
      <p>Energy is a large environmental issue surrounding the use of cloud technology. Data centres can consist of thousands of servers that draw large amounts of power and it is important that this power is utilised as much as possible. A 500m data center can use up to 27048 kilowatt-hours (kWh) every day which is roughly 2500x more than the average EU household. Companies are now looking at adopting green energy sources to power centers as well as other methods like smart grids that can output various amounts of power depending on how much is needed</p>
      <h3>Everything as a Service</h3>
      <p>The rapid expansion of cloud computing means that cloud-based services will see a large growth. Many current services offered are already extremely popular with many businesses due to the flexibility and cheap cost such as Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). Large host companies like Amazons Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Googles Compute Engine will all continue to grow</p>
