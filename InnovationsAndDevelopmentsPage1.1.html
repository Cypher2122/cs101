      <h1>INNOVATIONS</h1>
      <br>
      <p>Throughout recent years, the innovations and developments of cloud computing which have occurred have been staggering both from a business and user perspective and also for the effects these developments have had on the environment. The main reason for this being because of the growing need for people to store meaningful data resulting in many individuals and companies using public, private and hybrid clouds differently ultimately forging trends which, as computing science studies progresses, will keep gaining more attention (Roussey, 2018). 

      One of the developments taking place within cloud computing is multi-cloud strategies. A multi-cloud is simply multiple clouds being utilised simultaneously, most of the time because of the different functionalities offered by the various providers. Some of these different functionalities include the speed of data transfer to and from the cloud, the cost of upkeep in relation to the amount of storage and the different features made accessible by the providers such as applications like Google Docs which allows multiple users to access and edit the same document making it easier to accomplish work within a group (Roussey, 2018). However, some challenges of multi cloud storage which companies may face is that it requires more security as the separate clouds mean a larger target, it can be confusing for people when using multiple clouds for different purposes as they might find them harder to navigate (IDC, 2018). Perhaps one of the biggest cons of multi-cloud is that some providers offer discounts when their services are used in bulk, therefore many small businesses will opt for a single cloud as it may be cheaper and more accessible for them to run (Rouse, 2017). Hybrid clouds are also used which is a form of multi-cloud which combines both private and public clouds together creating a space perfect for companies with specific demands to achieve a specific task (Varghese, Buyya, 2017). Unlike a multi-cloud, this type of cloud is more secure as it is partly private, meaning that only the operator of the cloud can access it. This in turn, in addition to giving a company a more secure environment to store their sensitive information, gives them more control over the running of the cloud. Federated clouds also exist which is when different providers join together to combine many different features into one space. This can be beneficial for users is it would be less confusing to navigate as well as providing more features for a cheaper upkeep cost. It is most notably beneficial for the cloud providers however as it brings them together helping to eradicate the problem of vendor lock-in, which is when a customer becomes dependant on one business for the services (Evans, 2015). This is especially the case for small cloud providers as they may want to collaborate in a federated cloud to expand their horizons. Federated clouds also help prevent legal issues such as a copyright as it lets the businesses work together (Varghese, Buyya, 2017).
