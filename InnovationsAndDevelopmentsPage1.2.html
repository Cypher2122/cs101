      <p>Another development taking place within cloud computing is commercial clouds such as cloud gaming which allows users to stream video games over the internet where the game isn’t actually stored on your device, it is stored on a remote cloud server<a href="ReferencesInnovations.html"> (Armstrong, 2012)</a>. Many benefits to this include being able to play a multitude of games even with a limited storage capacity on your device because the games aren’t being downloaded onto your system, you’re just streaming them. However, the problem of internet arises as to stream a game off of the cloud, you must have a relatively strong internet connection. This then again creates bandwidth issues meaning people from rural areas may experience a lot of connectivity issues. A workaround to this in which Sony have developed, for their cloud gaming platform PlayStation Now, is to allow users to download games from their cloud which then results in users being able to play these games offline<a href="ReferencesInnovations.html"> (Moscaritolo, 2018)</a>. Another example of a commercial cloud is Netflix which creates an application to allow users to stream TVs and movies which are also stored in a remote cloud. This is a particularly notable case of commercial cloud as Netflix was responsible for paving a whole new system for watching movies and TV shows, a system in which other businesses like blockbuster could not compete with. However, a problem which has occurred in the past with Netflix is security problems and, as previously stated, this is one of the biggest downfalls of a company using private clouds to provide a service<a href="ReferencesInnovations.html"> (Greene, 2011)</a>. 

      Other developments in recent years to cloud computing include a severe increase to cloud storage capacity with the global total storage space approximately increasing from 1120 Exabyte’s in 2017 to around 1450 Exabyte’s in 2018, showing a total increase of 330 Exabyte’s over the year<a href="ReferencesInnovations.html"> (Statista, 2018)</a>. It is estimated that in the next coming years, the storage capacity of clouds could rise as high to around 2250 Exabyte’s in 2021. With this mass increase in storage per annum, businesses may take advantage of the new space. Big businesses storing large of amounts of big data will be able to store much more data sets giving them more information to analyse which, in turn, will provide valuable understandings of areas such as the behaviour of consumers and future investment strategies for monetary gain<a href="ReferencesInnovations.html"> (Puranik, 2017)</a>. Small businesses will also be able to take advantage of this new space by being able to offer more to customers for a lower price therefore providing better deals and outshining the competition ultimately giving themselves more business and obtaining more loyalty off of their customers.
