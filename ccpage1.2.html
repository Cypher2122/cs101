      <h5>Carbon footprint</h5>
      Cloud computing is easily available to the public, and this accessibility is an important factor in the relevance today, and for the future of cloud computing. “A public cloud, as its name suggests, is available to the public at large. In this regard, the public can be a consumer or an organization that wants to use cloud services.” (Ruparelia, 2016). It is doubtlessly an industry of great appeal to a global market, businesses and individuals can connect to the cloud through the internet, from practically anywhere in the world. This can of course greatly increase efficiency of data transfer, while simultaneously having a much smaller effect on the environment. It is estimated that the ICT industry supplies around 2% of the global carbon dioxide emissions, equivalent to that of the aviation industry (Gangadharan and Murugesan, 2012). The current environmental effect of the computing industry is of great concern, and cloud computing is of appeal, as it can help to reduce these emissions greatly. Small businesses found that using cloud services reduced their carbon emissions by up to 90%, and larger businesses as high as 60% (Gangadharan and Murugesan, 2012). If cloud networking becomes the primary system in use, the effect on the environment would be massive.

      <h5>Summation</h5>
      Overall it is clear that cloud computing is currently a very relevant development concerning the effects of the computing industry on the environment. A cloud network reduces carbon emissions by using more efficient servers run by an external data centre. These servers are able to be used at peak efficiency as they can be turned off or used for another purpose when no longer needed by one particular user. Businesses are interested in cloud computing because it saves the cooling and maintenance costs, while increasing work efficiency. Teams can work on the same project from anywhere in the world, and data can be shared with clients instantly. Anyone can use a cloud network, as it as very accessible, and they can be kept limited to specific users. A private cloud can keep data safe, or if some data needs to be public, hybrid clouds are also available. Cloud computing suits the needs of practically any end-user, is easily accessible, reduces carbon emissions and saves money, making it a very appealing system for business and individual alike.
